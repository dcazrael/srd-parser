#### Fireball

Level 3, Evocation, [Sorcerer, Wizard]

**Casting Time**: Action

**Range**: 150 feet

**Components**: V, S, M (a ball of bat guano and sulfur)

**Duration**: Instantaneous

A bright streak flashes from you to a point you choose within range and then blossoms with a low roar into a fiery explosion. Each creature in a 20-foot-radius Sphere centered on that point makes a Dexterity saving throw, taking 8d6 Fire damage on a failed save or half as much damage on a successful one.

Flammable objects in the area that arenâ€™t being worn or carried start burning.

**Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot**. The damage increases by 1d6 for each spell slot level above 3.
