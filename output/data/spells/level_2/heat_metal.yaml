description: 'Choose a manufactured metal object, such as a metal weapon or a suit
    of Heavy or Medium metal armor, that you can see within range. You cause the object
    to glow red-hot. Any creature in physical contact with the object takes 2d8 Fire
    damage when you cast the spell. Until the spell ends, you can take a Bonus Action
    on each of your later turns to deal this damage again if the object is within
    range.


    If a creature is holding or wearing the object and takes the damage from it, the
    creature must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or drop the object if it
    can. If it doesnâ€™t drop the object, it has Disadvantage on attack rolls and ability
    checks until the start of your next turn. '
