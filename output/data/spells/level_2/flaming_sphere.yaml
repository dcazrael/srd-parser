description: 'You create a 5-foot-diameter sphere of fire in an unoccupied space on
    the ground within range. It lasts for the duration. Any creature that ends its
    turn within 5 feet of the sphere makes a Dexterity saving throw, taking 2d6 Fire
    damage on a failed save or half as much damage on a successful one.


    As a Bonus Action, you can move the sphere up to 30 feet, rolling it along the
    ground. If you move the sphere into a creature’s space, that creature makes the
    save against the sphere, and the sphere stops moving for the turn.


    When you move the sphere, you can direct it over barriers up to 5 feet tall and
    jump it across pits up to 10 feet wide. Flammable objects that aren’t being worn
    or carried start burning if touched by the sphere, and it sheds Bright Light in
    a 20-foot radius and Dim Light for an additional 20 feet. '
