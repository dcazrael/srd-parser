description: 'A silvery beam of pale light shines down in a 5-foot-radius, 40-foot-high
    Cylinder centered on a point within range. Until the spell ends, Dim Light fills
    the Cylinder, and you can take a Magic action on later turns to move the Cylinder
    up to 60 feet.


    When the Cylinder appears, each creature in it makes a Constitution saving throw.
    On a failed save, a creature takes 2d10 Radiant damage, and if the creature is
    shape-shifted (as a result of the Polymorph spell, for example), it reverts to
    its true form and can’t shape-shift until it leaves the Cylinder.


    On a successful save, a creature takes half as much damage only. A creature also
    makes this save when the spell’s area moves into its space and when it enters
    the spell’s area or ends its turn there. A creature makes this save only once
    per turn. '
