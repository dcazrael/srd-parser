description: 'The ground in a 20-foot-radius Sphere centered on a point within range
    sprouts hard spikes and thorns. The area becomes Difficult Terrain for the duration.
    When a creature moves into or within the area, it takes 2d4 Piercing damage for
    every 5 feet it travels.


    The transformation of the ground is camouflaged to look natural. Any creature
    that canâ€™t see the area when the spell is cast must take a Search action and succeed
    on a Wisdom (Perception or Survival) check against your spell save DC to recognize
    the terrain as hazardous before entering it.'
