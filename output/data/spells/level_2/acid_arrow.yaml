description: 'A shimmering green arrow streaks toward a target within range and bursts
    in a spray of acid. Make a ranged spell attack against the target. On a hit, the
    target takes 4d4 Acid damage and 2d4 Acid damage at the end of its next turn.
    On a miss, the arrow splashes the target with acid for half as much of the initial
    damage only. '
