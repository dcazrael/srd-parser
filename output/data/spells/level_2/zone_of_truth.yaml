description: 'You create a magical zone that guards against deception in a 15-foot-radius
    Sphere centered on a point within range. Until the spell ends, a creature that
    enters the spell’s area for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there
    makes a Charisma saving throw. On a failed save, a creature can’t speak a deliberate
    lie while in the radius. You know whether a creature succeeds or fails on this
    save.


    An affected creature is aware of the spell and can avoid answering questions to
    which it would normally respond with a lie. Such a creature can be evasive yet
    must be truthful.'
