    in a 10-foot-radius Sphere centered there makes a Constitution saving throw, taking
    3d8 Thunder damage on a failed save or half as much damage on a successful one.
    A Construct has Disadvantage on the save.


    A nonmagical object that isn’t being worn or carried also takes the damage if
    it’s in the spell’s area. '
