description: 'You conjure a mass of sticky webbing at a point within range. The webs
    fill a 20-foot Cube there for the duration. The webs are Difficult Terrain, and
    the area within them is Lightly Obscured.


    If the webs arenâ€™t anchored between two solid masses (such as walls or trees)
    or layered across a floor, wall, or ceiling, the web collapses on itself, and
    the spell ends at the start of your next turn. Webs layered over a flat surface
    have a depth of 5 feet.


    The first time a creature enters the webs on a turn or starts its turn there,
    it must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or have the Restrained condition while
    in the webs or until it breaks free.


    A creature Restrained by the webs can take an action to make a Strength (Athletics)
    check against your spell save DC. If it succeeds, it is no longer Restrained.


    The webs are flammable. Any 5-foot Cube of webs exposed to fire burns away in
    1 round, dealing 2d4 Fire damage to any creature that starts its turn in the fire.'
