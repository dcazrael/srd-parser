description: 'You summon an otherworldly being that appears as a loyal steed in an
    unoccupied space of your choice within range. This creature uses the Otherworldly
    Steed stat block. If you already have a steed from this spell, the steed is replaced
    by the new one.


    The steed resembles a Large, rideable animal of your choice, such as a horse,
    a camel, a dire wolf, or an elk. Whenever you cast the spell, choose the steed’s
    creature type — Celestial, Fey, or Fiend— which determines certain traits in the
    stat block. '

-   name: Combat
    text: The steed is an ally to you and your allies. In combat, it shares your Initiative
        count, and it functions as a controlled mount while you ride it (as defined
        in the rules on mounted combat). If you have the Incapacitated condition,
        the steed takes its turn immediately after yours and acts independently, focusing
        on protecting you.
-   name: Disappearance of the Steed
    text: The steed disappears if it drops to 0 Hit Points or if you die. When it
        disappears, it leaves behind anything it was wearing or carrying. If you cast
        this spell again, you decide whether you summon the steed that disappeared
        or a different one.
