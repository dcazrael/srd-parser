description: 'You touch a closed door, window, gate, container, or hatch and magically
    lock it for the duration. This lock canâ€™t be unlocked by any nonmagical means.


    You and any creatures you designate when you cast the spell can open and close
    the object despite the lock. You can also set a password that, when spoken within
    5 feet of the object, unlocks it for 1 minute.'
