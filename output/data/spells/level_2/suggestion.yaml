description: 'You suggest a course of activity — described in no more than 25 words
    — to one creature you can see within range that can hear and understand you. The
    suggestion must sound achievable and not involve anything that would obviously
    deal damage to the target or its allies. For example, you could say, “Fetch the
    key to the cult’s treasure vault, and give the key to me.” Or you could say, “Stop
    fighting, leave this library peacefully, and don’t return.”


    The target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or have the Charmed condition
    for the duration or until you or your allies deal damage to the target. The Charmed
    target pursues the suggestion to the best of its ability. The suggested activity


    can continue for the entire duration, but if the suggested activity can be completed
    in a shorter time, the spell ends for the target upon completing it.'
