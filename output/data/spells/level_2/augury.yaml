description: 'You receive an omen from an otherworldly entity about the results of
    a course of action that you plan to take within the next 30 minutes. The GM chooses
    the omen from the Omens table.


    ###### Omens


    | Omen         | For Results That Will Be … | |--------------|----------------------------|
    | Weal         | Good                       | | Woe          | Bad                        |
    | Weal and woe | Good and bad               | | Indifference | Neither good nor
    bad       |


    The spell doesn’t account for circumstances, such as other spells, that might
    change the results.


    If you cast the spell more than once before finishing a Long Rest, there is a
    cumulative 25 percent chance for each casting after the first that you get no
    answer.'
