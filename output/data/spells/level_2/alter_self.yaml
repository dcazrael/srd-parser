subsections:
-   name: Aquatic Adaptation
    text: You sprout gills and grow webs between your fingers. You can breathe underwater
        and gain a Swim Speed equal to your Speed.
-   name: Change Appearance
    text: You alter your appearance. You decide what you look like, including your
        height, weight, facial features, sound of your voice, hair length, coloration,
        and other distinguishing characteristics. You can make yourself appear as
        a member of another species, though none of your statistics change. You can’t
        appear as a creature of a different size, and your basic shape stays the same;
        if you’re bipedal, you can’t use this spell to become quadrupedal, for instance.
        For the duration, you can take a Magic action to change your appearance in
        this way again.
-   name: Natural Weapons
    text: You grow claws (Slashing), fangs (Piercing), horns (Piercing), or hooves
        (Bludgeoning). When you use your Unarmed Strike to deal damage with that new
        growth, it deals 1d6 damage of the type in parentheses instead of dealing
        the normal damage for your Unarmed Strike, and you use your spellcasting ability
        modifier for the attack and damage rolls rather than using Strength.
