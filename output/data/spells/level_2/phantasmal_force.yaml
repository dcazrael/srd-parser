description: 'You attempt to craft an illusion in the mind of a creature you can see
    within range. The target makes an Intelligence saving throw. On a failed save,
    you create a phantasmal object, creature, or other phenomenon that is no larger
    than a 10-foot Cube and that is perceivable only to the target for the duration.
    The phantasm includes sound, temperature, and other stimuli.


    The target can take a Study action to examine the phantasm with an Intelligence
    (Investigation) check against your spell save DC. If the check succeeds, the target
    realizes that the phantasm is an illusion, and the spell ends.


    While affected by the spell, the target treats the phantasm as if it were real
    and rationalizes any illogical outcomes from interacting with it. For example,
    if the target steps through a phantasmal bridge and survives the fall, it believes
    the bridge exists and something else caused it to fall.


    An affected target can even take damage from the illusion if the phantasm represents
    a dangerous creature or hazard. On each of your turns, such a phantasm can deal
    2d8 Psychic damage to the target if it is in the phantasmâ€™s area or within 5 feet
    of the phantasm. The target perceives the damage as a type appropriate to the
    illusion.'
