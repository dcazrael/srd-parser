    **Duration**: 1 hour


    You touch another creature that is willing and create a mystic connection between
    you and the target until the spell ends. While the target is within 60 feet of
    you, it gains a +1 bonus to AC and saving throws, and it has Resistance to all
    damage. Also, each time it takes damage, you take the same amount of damage.


    The spell ends if you drop to 0 Hit Points or if you and the target become separated
    by more than 60 feet. It also ends if the spell is cast again on either of the
    connected creatures.'
