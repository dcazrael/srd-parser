description: 'You sense any trap within range that is within line of sight. A trap,
    for the purpose of this spell, includes any object or mechanism that was created
    to cause damage or other danger. Thus, the spell would sense the Alarm or Glyph
    of Warding spell or a mechanical pit trap, but it wouldnâ€™t reveal a natural weakness
    in the floor, an unstable ceiling, or a hidden sinkhole.


    This spell reveals that a trap is present but not its location. You do learn the
    general nature of the danger posed by a trap you sense.'
