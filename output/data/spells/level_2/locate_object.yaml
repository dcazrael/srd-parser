description: 'Describe or name an object that is familiar to you. You sense the direction
    to the object’s location if that object is within 1,000 feet of you. If the object
    is in motion, you know the direction of its movement.


    The spell can locate a specific object known to you if you have seen it up close
    — within 30 feet — at least once. Alternatively, the spell can locate the nearest
    object of a particular kind, such as a certain kind of apparel, jewelry, furniture,
    tool, or weapon.


    This spell can’t locate an object if any thickness of lead blocks a direct path
    between you and the object.'
