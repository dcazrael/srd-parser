    choice and lasts for the duration. The force appears within range in a space of
    your choice, and you can immediately make one melee spell attack against one creature
    within 5 feet of the force. On a hit, the target takes Force damage equal to 1d8
    plus your spellcasting ability modifier.


    As a Bonus Action on your later turns, you can move the force up to 20 feet and
    repeat the attack against a creature within 5 feet of it. '
