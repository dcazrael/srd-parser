-   name: Sense Thoughts
    text: You sense the presence of thoughts within 30 feet of yourself that belong
        to creatures that know languages or are telepathic. You don’t read the thoughts,
        but you know that a thinking creature is present.  The spell is blocked by
        1 foot of stone, dirt, or wood; 1 inch of metal; or a thin sheet of lead.
-   name: Read Thoughts
    text: Target one creature you can see within 30 feet of yourself or one creature
        within 30 feet of yourself that you detected with the Sense Thoughts option.
        You learn what is most on the target’s mind right now. If the target doesn’t
        know any languages and isn’t telepathic, you learn nothing.  As a Magic action
        on your next turn, you can try to probe deeper into the target’s mind. If
        you probe deeper, the target makes a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save,
        you discern the target’s reasoning, emotions, and something that looms large
        in its mind (such as a worry, love, or hate). On a successful save, the spell
        ends. Either way, the target knows that you are probing into its mind, and
        until you shift your attention away from the target’s mind, the target can
        take an action on its turn to make an Intelligence (Arcana) check against
        your spell save DC, ending the spell on a success.
