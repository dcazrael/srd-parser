description: 'You and up to eight willing creatures who link hands in a circle are
    transported to a different plane of existence. You can specify a target destination
    in general terms, such as a specific city on the Elemental Plane of Fire or palace
    on the second level of the Nine Hells, and you appear in or near that destination,
    as determined by the GM.


    Alternatively, if you know the sigil sequence of a teleportation circle on another
    plane of existence, this spell can take you to that circle. If the teleportation
    circle is too small to hold all the creatures you transported, they appear in
    the closest unoccupied spaces next to the circle.'
