description: 'This spell instantly transports you and up to eight willing creatures
    that you can see within range, or a single object that you can see within range,
    to a destination you select. If you target an object, it must be Large or smaller,
    and it can’t be held or carried by an unwilling creature.


    The destination you choose must be known to you, and it must be on the same plane
    of existence as you. Your familiarity with the destination determines whether
    you arrive there successfully. The GM rolls 1d100 and consults the Teleportation
    Outcome table and the explanations after it.

-   name: Familiarity
    text: 'Here are the meanings of the terms in the table’s Familiarity column:  -
        “Permanent circle” means a permanent teleportation circle whose sigil sequence
        you know. - “Linked object” means you possess an object taken from the desired
        destination within the last six months, such as a   book from a wizard’s library.
        - “Very familiar” is a place you have visited often, a place you have carefully
        studied, or a place you can see when you   cast the spell. - “Seen casually”
        is a place you have seen more than once but with which you aren’t very familiar.
        - “Viewed once or described” is a place you have seen once, possibly using
        magic, or a place you know through someone   else’s description, perhaps from
        a map. - “False destination” is a place that doesn’t exist. Perhaps you tried
        to scry an enemy’s sanctum but instead viewed an   illusion, or you are attempting
        to teleport to a location that no longer exists.'
-   name: Mishap
    text: The spell’s unpredictable magic results in a difficult journey. Each teleporting
        creature (or the target object) takes 3d10 Force damage, and the GM re-rolls
        on the table to see where you wind up (multiple mishaps can occur, dealing
        damage each time).
-   name: Similar Area
    text: You and your group (or the target object) appear in a different area that’s
        visually or thematically similar to the target area. You appear in the closest
        similar place. If you are heading for your home laboratory, for example, you
        might appear in another person’s laboratory in the same city.
-   name: Off Target
    text: 'You and your group (or the target object) appear 2d12 miles away from the
        destination in a random direction. Roll 1d8 for the direction: 1, east; 2,
        southeast; 3, south; 4, southwest; 5, west; 6, northwest; 7, north; or 8,
        northeast.'
-   name: On Target
    text: You and your group (or the target object) appear where you intended.
