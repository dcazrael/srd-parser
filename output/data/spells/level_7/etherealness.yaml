description: 'You step into the border regions of the Ethereal Plane, where it overlaps
    with your current plane. You remain in the Border Ethereal for the duration. During
    this time, you can move in any direction. If you move up or down, every foot of
    movement costs an extra foot. You can perceive the plane you left, which looks
    gray, and you can’t see anything there more than 60 feet away.


    While on the Ethereal Plane, you can affect and be affected only by creatures,
    objects, and effects on that plane. Creatures that aren’t on the Ethereal Plane
    can’t perceive or interact with you unless a feature gives them the ability to
    do so.


    When the spell ends, you return to the plane you left in the spot that corresponds
    to your space in the Border Ethereal. If you appear in an occupied space, you
    are shunted to the nearest unoccupied space and take Force damage equal to twice
    the number of feet you are moved.


    This spell ends instantly if you cast it while you are on the Ethereal Plane or
    a plane that doesn’t border it, such as one of the Outer Planes. '
