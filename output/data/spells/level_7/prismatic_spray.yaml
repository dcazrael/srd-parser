    in the Cone makes a Dexterity saving throw. For each target, roll 1d8 to determine

    | 6   | Indigo  | Failed Save: The target is Restrained. At the end of each turn,
    it makes a CON save. 3 successes end the condition. 3 failures result in Petrified
    until freed (e.g., via Greater Restoration). Successes and failures are tracked.
    | | 7   | Violet  | Failed Save: The target is Blinded. At the start of your next
    turn, it makes a WIS save. On success: the condition ends. On failure: the condition
    ends and the target teleports to another plane (GM''s choice).                    |
    | 8   | Special | The target is struck by two rays. Roll twice, rerolling any
    8.                                                                                                                                                                      |'
