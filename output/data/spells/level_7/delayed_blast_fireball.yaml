description: 'A beam of yellow light flashes from you, then condenses at a chosen
    point within range as a glowing bead for the duration. When the spell ends, the
    bead explodes, and each creature in a 20-foot-radius Sphere centered on that point
    makes a Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes Fire damage equal to the total
    accumulated damage on a failed save or half as much damage on a successful one.


    The spell’s base damage is 12d6, and the damage increases by 1d6 whenever your
    turn ends and the spell hasn’t ended.


    If a creature touches the glowing bead before the spell ends, that creature makes
    a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the spell ends, causing the bead to
    explode. On a successful save, the creature can throw the bead up to 40 feet.
    If the thrown bead enters a creature’s space or collides with a solid object,
    the spell ends, and the bead explodes.


    When the bead explodes, flammable objects in the explosion that aren’t being worn
    or carried start burning. '
