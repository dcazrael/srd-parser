description: 'You inscribe a harmful glyph either on a surface (such as a section
    of floor or wall) or within an object that can be closed (such as a book or chest).
    The glyph can cover an area no larger than 10 feet in diameter. If you choose
    an object, it must remain in place; if it is moved more than 10 feet from where
    you cast this spell, the glyph is broken, and the spell ends without being triggered.


    The glyph is nearly imperceptible and requires a successful Wisdom (Perception)
    check against your spell save DC to notice.


    When you inscribe the glyph, you set its trigger and choose which effect the symbol
    bears: Death, Discord, Fear, Pain, Sleep, or Stunning. Each one is explained below. '

subsections:
-   name: Set the Trigger
    text: You decide what triggers the glyph when you cast the spell. For glyphs inscribed
        on a surface, common triggers include touching or stepping on the glyph, removing
        another object covering it, or approaching within a certain distance of it.
        For glyphs inscribed within an object, common triggers include opening that
        object or seeing the glyph.  You can refine the trigger so that only creatures
        of certain types activate it (for example, the glyph could be set to affect
        Aberrations). You can also set conditions for creatures that donâ€™t trigger
        the glyph, such as those who say a certain password.  Once triggered, the
        glyph glows, filling a 60-foot-radius Sphere with Dim Light for 10 minutes,
        after which time the spell ends. Each creature in the Sphere when the glyph
        activates is targeted by its effect, as is a creature that enters the Sphere
        for the first time on a turn or ends its turn there. A creature is targeted
        only once per turn.
-   name: Death
    text: Each target makes a Constitution saving throw, taking 10d10 Necrotic damage
        on a failed save or half as much damage on a successful save.
-   name: Discord
    text: Each target makes a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, a target argues
        with other creatures for 1 minute. During this time, it is incapable of meaningful
        communication and has Disadvantage on attack rolls and ability checks.
-   name: Fear
    text: Each target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or have the Frightened
        condition for 1 minute. While Frightened, the target must move at least 30
        feet away from the glyph on each of its turns, if able.
-   name: Pain
    text: Each target must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or have the Incapacitated
        condition for 1 minute.
-   name: Sleep
    text: Each target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or have the Unconscious
        condition for 10 minutes. A creature awakens if it takes damage or if someone
        takes an action to shake it awake.
-   name: Stunning
    text: Each target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or have the Stunned condition
        for 1 minute.
