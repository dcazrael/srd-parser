description: 'You create a spectral sword that hovers within range. It lasts for the
    duration.


    When the sword appears, you make a melee spell attack against a target within
    5 feet of the sword. On a hit, the target takes Force damage equal to 4d12 plus
    your spellcasting ability modifier.


    On your later turns, you can take a Bonus Action to move the sword up to 30 feet
    to a spot you can see and repeat the attack against the same target or a different
    one.'
