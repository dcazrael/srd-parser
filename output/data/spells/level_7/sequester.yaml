description: 'With a touch, you magically sequester an object or a willing creature.
    For the duration, the target has the Invisible condition and can’t be targeted
    by Divination spells, detected by magic, or viewed remotely with magic.


    If the target is a creature, it enters a state of suspended animation; it has
    the Unconscious condition, doesn’t age, and doesn’t need food, water, or air.


    You can set a condition for the spell to end early. The condition can be anything
    you choose, but it must occur or be visible within 1 mile of the target. Examples
    include “after 1,000 years” or “when the tarrasque awakens.” This spell also ends
    if the target takes any damage.'
