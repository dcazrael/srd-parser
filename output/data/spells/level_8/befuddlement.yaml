description: 'You blast the mind of a creature that you can see within range. The
    target makes an Intelligence saving throw.


    On a failed save, the target takes 10d12 Psychic damage and canâ€™t cast spells
    or take the Magic action. At the end of every 30 days, the target repeats the
    save, ending the effect on a success. The effect can also be ended by the Greater
    Restoration, Heal, or Wish spell.


    On a successful save, the target takes half as much damage only.'
