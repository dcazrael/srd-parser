description: 'You create a shadowy Medium door on a flat solid surface that you can
    see within range. This door can be opened and closed, and it leads to a demiplane
    that is an empty room 30 feet in each dimension, made of wood or stone (your choice).


    When the spell ends, the door vanishes, and any objects inside the demiplane remain
    there. Any creatures inside also remain unless they opt to be shunted through
    the door as it vanishes, landing with the Prone condition in the unoccupied spaces
    closest to the doorâ€™s former space.


    Each time you cast this spell, you can create a new demiplane or connect the shadowy
    door to a demiplane you created with a previous casting of this spell. Additionally,
    if you know the nature and contents of a demiplane created by a casting of this
    spell by another creature, you can connect the shadowy door to that demiplane
    instead.'
