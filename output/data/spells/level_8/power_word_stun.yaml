description: 'You overwhelm the mind of one creature you can see within range. If
    the target has 150 Hit Points or fewer, it has the Stunned condition. Otherwise,
    its Speed is 0 until the start of your next turn.


    The Stunned target makes a Constitution saving throw at the end of each of its
    turns, ending the condition on itself on a success.'
