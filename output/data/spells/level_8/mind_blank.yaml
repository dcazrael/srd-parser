description: Until the spell ends, one willing creature you touch has Immunity to
    Psychic damage and the Charmed condition. The target is also unaffected by anything
    that would sense its emotions or alignment, read its thoughts, or magically detect
    its location, and no spell — not even Wish — can gather information about the
    target, observe it remotely, or control its mind.
