description: 'As you cast the spell, choose whether it creates antipathy or sympathy,
    and target one creature or object that is Huge or smaller. Then specify a kind
    of creature, such as red dragons, goblins, or vampires. A creature of the chosen
    kind makes a Wisdom saving throw when it comes within 120 feet of the target.
    Your choice of antipathy or sympathy determines what happens to a creature when
    it fails that save: '

    text: The creature has the Frightened condition. The Frightened creature must
        use its movement on its turns to get as far away as possible from the target,
        moving by the safest route.
-   name: Sympathy
    text: The creature has the Charmed condition. The Charmed creature must use its
        movement on its turns to get as close as possible to the target, moving by
        the safest route. If the creature is within 5 feet of the target, the creature
        canâ€™t willingly move away. If the target damages the Charmed creature, that
        creature can make a Wisdom saving throw to end the effect, as described below.
-   name: Ending the Effect
    text: If the Frightened or Charmed creature ends its turn more than 120 feet away
        from the target, the creature makes a Wisdom saving throw. On a successful
        save, the creature is no longer affected by the target. A creature that successfully
        saves against this effect is immune to it for 1 minute, after which it can
        be affected again.
