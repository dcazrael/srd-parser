description: "You take control of the weather within 5 miles of you for the duration.\
    \ You must be outdoors to cast this spell, and it ends early if you go indoors.\n\
    \nWhen you cast the spell, you change the current weather conditions, which are\
    \ determined by the GM. You can change precipitation, temperature, and wind. It\
    \ takes 1d4 Ã— 10 minutes for the new conditions to take effect. Once they do so,\
    \ you can change the conditions again. When the spell ends, the weather gradually\
    \ returns to normal. When you change the weather conditions, find a current condition\
    \ on the following tables and change its stage by one, up or down. When changing\
    \ the wind, you can change its direction.\n\n###### Precipitation\n\n| Stage |\
