description: 'Choose a point on the ground that you can see within range. For the
    duration, an intense tremor rips through the ground in a 100-foot-radius circle
    centered on that point. The ground there is Difficult Terrain.


    When you cast this spell and at the end of each of your turns for the duration,
    each creature on the ground in the area makes a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed
    save, a creature has the Prone condition, and its Concentration is broken.


    You can also cause the effects below. '

-   name: Fissures
    text: A total of 1d6 fissures open in the spell’s area at the end of the turn
        you cast it. You choose the fissures’ locations, which can’t be under structures.
        Each fissure is 1d10 × 10 feet deep and 10 feet wide, and it extends from
        one edge of the spell’s area to another edge. A creature in the same space
        as a fissure must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or fall in. A creature
        that successfully saves moves with the fissure’s edge as it opens.
-   name: Structures
    text: The tremor deals 50 Bludgeoning damage to any structure in contact with
        the ground in the area when you cast the spell and at the end of each of your
        turns until the spell ends. If a structure drops to 0 Hit Points, it collapses.  A
        creature within a distance from a collapsing structure equal to half the structure’s
        height makes a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes
        12d6 Bludgeoning damage, has the Prone condition, and is buried in the rubble,
        requiring a DC 20 Strength (Athletics) check as an action to escape. On a
        successful save, the creature takes half as much damage only.
