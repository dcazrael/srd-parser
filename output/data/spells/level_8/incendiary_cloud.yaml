description: 'A swirling cloud of embers and smoke fills a 20-foot-radius Sphere centered
    on a point within range. The cloudâ€™s area is Heavily Obscured. It lasts for the
    duration or until a strong wind (like that created by Gust of Wind) disperses
    it.


    When the cloud appears, each creature in it makes a Dexterity saving throw, taking
    10d8 Fire damage on a failed save or half as much damage on a successful one.
    A creature must also make this save when the Sphere moves into its space and when
    it enters the Sphere or ends its turn there. A creature makes this save only once
    per turn.


    The cloud moves 10 feet away from you in a direction you choose at the start of
    each of your turns.'
