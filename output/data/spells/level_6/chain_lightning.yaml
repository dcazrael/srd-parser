description: 'You launch a lightning bolt toward a target you can see within range.
    Three bolts then leap from that target to as many as three other targets of your
    choice, each of which must be within 30 feet of the first target. A target can
    be a creature or an object and can be targeted by only one of the bolts.


    Each target makes a Dexterity saving throw, taking 10d8 Lightning damage on a
    failed save or half as much damage on a successful one. '
