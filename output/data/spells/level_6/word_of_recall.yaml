description: 'You and up to five willing creatures within 5 feet of you instantly
    teleport to a previously designated **sanctuary**. You and any creatures that
    teleport with you appear in the nearest unoccupied space to the spot you designated
    when you prepared your sanctuary (see below). If you cast this spell without first
    preparing a sanctuary, the spell has no effect.


    You must designate a location, such as a temple, as a sanctuary by casting this
    spell there.'
