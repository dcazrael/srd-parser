description: 'You touch the sapphire used in the casting and an object weighing 10
    pounds or less whose longest dimension is 6 feet or less. The spell leaves an
    Invisible mark on that object and invisibly inscribes the object’s name on the
    sapphire. Each time you cast this spell, you must use a different sapphire.


    Thereafter, you can take a Magic action to speak the object’s name and crush the
    sapphire. The object instantly appears in your hand regardless of physical or
    planar distances, and the spell ends.


    If another creature is holding or carrying the object, crushing the sapphire doesn’t
    transport it, but instead you learn who that creature is and where that creature
    is currently located.'
