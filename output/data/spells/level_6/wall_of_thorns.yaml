description: 'You create a wall of tangled brush bristling with needle-sharp thorns.
    The wall appears within range on a solid surface and lasts for the duration. You
    choose to make the wall up to 60 feet long, 10 feet high, and 5 feet thick or
    a circle that has a 20-foot diameter and is up to 20 feet high and 5 feet thick.
    The wall blocks line of sight.


    When the wall appears, each creature in its area makes a Dexterity saving throw,
    taking 7d8 Piercing damage on a failed save or half as much damage on a successful
    one.


    A creature can move through the wall, albeit slowly and painfully. For every 1
    foot a creature moves through the wall, it must spend 4 feet of movement. Furthermore,
    the first time a creature enters a space in the wall on a turn or ends its turn
    there, the creature makes a Dexterity saving throw, taking 7d8 Slashing damage
    on a failed save or half as much damage on a successful one. A creature makes
    this save only once per turn. '
