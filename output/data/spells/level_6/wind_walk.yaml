description: 'You and up to ten willing creatures of your choice within range assume
    gaseous forms for the duration, appearing as wisps of cloud. While in this cloud
    form, a target has a Fly Speed of 300 feet and can hover; it has Immunity to the
    Prone condition; and it has Resistance to Bludgeoning, Piercing, and Slashing
    damage. The only actions a target can take in this form are the Dash action or
    a Magic action to begin reverting to its normal form. Reverting takes 1 minute,
    during which the target has the Stunned condition. Until the spell ends, the target
    can revert to cloud form, which also requires a Magic action followed by a 1-minute
    transformation.


    If a target is in cloud form and flying when the effect ends, the target descends
    60 feet per round for 1 minute until it lands, which it does safely. If it canâ€™t
    land after 1 minute, it falls the remaining distance.'
