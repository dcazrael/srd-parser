description: 'You unleash virulent magic on a creature you can see within range. The
    target makes a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, it takes 14d6


    Necrotic damage, and its Hit Point maximum is reduced by an amount equal to the
    Necrotic damage it took. On a successful save, it takes half as much damage only.
    This spell can’t reduce a target’s Hit Point maximum below 1.'
