description: 'An immobile, shimmering barrier appears in a 10foot Emanation around
    you and remains for the duration.


    Any spell of level 5 or lower cast from outside the barrier canâ€™t affect anything
    within it. Such a spell can target creatures and objects within the barrier, but
    the spell has no effect on them. Similarly, the area within the barrier is excluded
    from areas of effect created by such spells. '
