description: 'You launch a green ray at a target you can see within range. The target
    can be a creature, a nonmagical object, or a creation of magical force, such as
    the wall created by Wall of Force.


    A creature targeted by this spell makes a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed
    save, the target takes 10d6 + 40 Force damage. If this damage reduces it to 0
    Hit Points, it and everything nonmagical it is wearing and carrying are disintegrated
    into gray dust. The target can be revived only by a True Resurrection or a Wish
    spell.


    This spell automatically disintegrates a Large or smaller nonmagical object or
    a creation of magical force. If such a target is Huge or larger, this spell disintegrates
    a 10-foot-Cube portion of it. '
