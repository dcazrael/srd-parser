description: 'A frigid globe streaks from you to a point of your choice within range,
    where it explodes in a 60-foot-radius Sphere. Each creature in that area makes
    a Constitution saving throw, taking 10d6 Cold damage on failed save or half as
    much damage on a successful one.


    If the globe strikes a body of water, it freezes the water to a depth of 6 inches
    over an area 30 feet square. This ice lasts for 1 minute. Creatures that were
    swimming on the surface of frozen water are trapped in the ice and have the Restrained
    condition. A trapped creature can take an action to make a Strength (Athletics)
    check against your spell save DC to break free.


    You can refrain from firing the globe after completing the spell’s casting. If
    you do so, a globe about the size of a sling bullet, cool to the touch, appears
    in your hand. At any time, you or a creature you give the globe to can throw the
    globe (to a range of 40 feet) or hurl it with a sling (to the sling’s normal range).
    It shatters on impact, with the same effect as a normal casting of the spell.
    You can also set the globe down without shattering it. After 1 minute, if the
    globe hasn’t already shattered, it explodes. '
