description: 'You create a wall of ice on a solid surface within range. You can form
    it into a hemispherical dome or a globe with a radius of up to 10 feet, or you
    can shape a flat surface made up of ten 10-foot-square panels. Each panel must
    be contiguous with another panel. In any form, the wall is 1 foot thick and lasts
    for the duration.


    If the wall cuts through a creatureâ€™s space when it appears, the creature is pushed
    to one side of the wall (you choose which side) and makes a Dexterity saving throw,
    taking 10d6 Cold damage on a failed save or half as much damage on a successful
    one.


    The wall is an object that can be damaged and thus breached. It has AC 12 and
    30 Hit Points per 10-foot section, and it has Immunity to Cold, Poison, and Psychic
    damage and Vulnerability to Fire damage. Reducing a 10-foot section of wall to
    0 Hit Points destroys it and leaves behind a sheet of frigid air in the space
    the wall occupied.


    A creature moving through the sheet of frigid air for the first time on a turn
    makes a Constitution saving throw, taking 5d6 Cold damage on a failed save or
    half as much damage on a successful one. '
