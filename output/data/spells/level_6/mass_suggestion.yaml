description: 'You suggest a course of activity — described in no more than 25 words
    — to twelve or fewer creatures you can see within range that can hear and understand
    you. The suggestion must sound achievable and not involve anything that would
    obviously deal damage to any of the targets or their allies. For example, you
    could say, “Walk to the village down that road, and help the villagers there harvest
    crops until sunset.” Or you could say, “Now is not the time for violence. Drop
    your weapons, and dance! Stop in an hour.”


    Each target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or have the Charmed condition
    for the duration or until you or your allies deal damage to the target. Each Charmed
    target pursues the suggestion to the best of its ability. The suggested activity
    can continue for the entire duration, but if the suggested activity can be completed
    in a shorter time, the spell ends for a target upon completing it. '
