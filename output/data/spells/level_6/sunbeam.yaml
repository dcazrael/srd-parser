description: 'You launch a sunbeam in a 5-foot-wide, 60-foot-long Line. Each creature
    in the Line makes a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes
    6d8 Radiant damage and has the Blinded condition until the start of your next
    turn. On a successful save, it takes half as much damage only.


    Until the spell ends, you can take a Magic action to create a new Line of radiance.


    For the duration, a mote of brilliant radiance shines above you. It sheds Bright
    Light in a 30-foot radius and Dim Light for an additional 30 feet. This light
    is sunlight.'
