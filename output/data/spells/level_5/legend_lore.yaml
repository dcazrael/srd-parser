description: 'Name or describe a famous person, place, or object. The spell brings
    to your mind a brief summary of the significant lore about that famous thing,
    as described by the GM.


    The lore might consist of important details, amusing revelations, or even secret
    lore that has never been widely known. The more information you already know about
    the thing, the more precise and detailed the information you receive is. That
    information is accurate but might be couched in figurative language or poetry,
    as determined by the GM.


    If the famous thing you chose isnâ€™t actually famous, you hear sad musical notes
    played on a trombone, and the spell fails.'
