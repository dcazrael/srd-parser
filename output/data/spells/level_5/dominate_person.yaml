description: 'One Humanoid you can see within range must succeed on a Wisdom saving
    throw or have the Charmed condition for the duration. The target has Advantage
    on the save if you or your allies are fighting it. Whenever the target takes damage,
    it repeats the save, ending the spell on itself on a success.


    You have a telepathic link with the Charmed target while the two of you are on
    the same plane of existence. On your turn, you can use this link to issue commands
    to the target (no action required), such as “Attack that creature,” “Move over
    there,” or “Fetch that object.” The target does its best to obey on its turn.
    If it completes an order and doesn’t receive further direction from you, it acts
    and moves as it likes, focusing on protecting itself.


    You can command the target to take a Reaction but must take your own Reaction
    to do so. '
