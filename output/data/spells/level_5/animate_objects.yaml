description: 'Objects animate at your command. Choose a number of nonmagical objects
    within range that aren’t being worn or carried, aren’t fixed to a surface, and
    aren’t Gargantuan. The maximum number of objects is equal to your spellcasting
    ability modifier; for this number, a Medium or smaller target counts as one object,
    a Large target counts as two, and a Huge target counts as three.


    Each target animates, sprouts legs, and becomes a Construct that uses the Animated
    Object stat block; this creature is under your control until the spell ends or
    until it is reduced to 0 Hit Points. Each creature you make with this spell is
    an ally to you and your allies. In combat, it shares your Initiative count and
    takes its turn immediately after yours.


    Until the spell ends, you can take a Bonus Action to mentally command any creature
    you made with this spell if the creature is within 500 feet of you (if you control
    multiple creatures, you can command any of them at the same time, issuing the
    same command to each one). If you issue no commands, the creature takes the Dodge
    action and moves only to avoid harm. When the creature drops to 0 Hit Points,
    it reverts to its object form, and any remaining damage carries over to that form. '
