description: 'spell consumes)


    **Duration**: 1 round


    As you cast the spell, you draw a 5-foot-radius circle on the ground inscribed
    with sigils that link your location to a permanent teleportation circle of your
    choice whose sigil sequence you know and that is on the same plane of existence
    as you. A shimmering portal opens within the circle you drew and remains open
    until the end of your next turn. Any creature that enters the portal instantly
    appears within 5 feet of the destination circle or in the nearest unoccupied space
    if that space is occupied.


    Many major temples, guildhalls, and other important places have permanent teleportation
    circles.


    Each circle includes a unique sigil sequence â€” a string of runes arranged in a
    particular pattern.


    When you first gain the ability to cast this spell, you learn the sigil sequences
    for two destinations on the Material Plane, determined by the GM. You might learn
    additional sigil sequences during your adventures. You can commit a new sigil
    sequence to memory after studying it for 1 minute.


    You can create a permanent teleportation circle by casting this spell in the same
    location every day for 365 days.'
