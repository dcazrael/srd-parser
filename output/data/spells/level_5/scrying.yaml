    **Duration**: Concentration, up to 10 minutes


    You can see and hear a creature you choose that is on the same plane of existence
    as you. The target makes a Wisdom saving throw, which is modified (see the tables
    below) by how well you know the target and the sort of physical connection you
    have to it. The target doesn’t know what it is making the save against, only that
    it feels uneasy.


    | Your Knowledge of the Target Is … | Save Modifier | |-----------------------------------|---------------|
    | Secondhand (heard of the target)  | +5            | | Firsthand (met the target)        |
    +0            | | Extensive (know the target well)  | −5            |


    | You Have the Target’s …                 | Save Modifier | |-----------------------------------------|---------------|
    | Picture or other likeness               | −2            | | Garment or other
    possession             | −4            | | Body part, lock of hair, or bit of
    nail | −10           |


    On a successful save, the target isn’t affected, and you can’t use this spell
    on it again for 24 hours.


    On a failed save, the spell creates an Invisible, intangible sensor within 10
    feet of the target. You can see and hear through the sensor as if you were there.
    The sensor moves with the target, remaining within 10 feet of it for the duration.
    If something can see the sensor, it appears as a luminous orb about the size of
    your fist.


    Instead of targeting a creature, you can target a location you have seen. When
    you do so, the sensor appears at that location and doesn’t move.'
