description: 'You attempt to bind a Celestial, an Elemental, a Fey, or a Fiend to
    your service. The creature must be within range for the entire casting of the
    spell. (Typically, the creature is first summoned into the center of the inverted
    version of the Magic Circle spell to trap it while this spell is cast.) At the
    completion of the casting, the target must succeed on a Charisma saving throw
    or be bound to serve you for the duration. If the creature was summoned or created
    by another spell, that spellâ€™s duration is extended to match the duration of this
    spell.


    A bound creature must follow your commands to the best of its ability. You might
    command the creature to accompany you on an adventure, to guard a location, or
    to deliver a message. If the creature is Hostile, it strives to twist your commands
    to achieve its own objectives. If the creature carries out your commands completely
    before the spell ends, it travels to you to report this fact if you are on the
    same plane of existence. If you are on a different plane, it returns to the place
    where you bound it and remains there until the spell ends. '
