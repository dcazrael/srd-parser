description: 'You contact a deity or a divine proxy and ask up to three questions
    that can be answered with yes or no. You must ask your questions before the spell
    ends. You receive a correct answer for each question.


    Divine beings aren’t necessarily omniscient, so you might receive “unclear” as
    an answer if a question pertains to information that lies beyond the deity’s knowledge.
    In a case where a one-word answer could be misleading or contrary to the deity’s
    interests, the GM might offer a short phrase as an answer instead.


    If you cast the spell more than once before finishing a Long Rest, there is a
    cumulative 25 percent chance for each casting after the first that you get no
    answer.'
