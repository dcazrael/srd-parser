description: 'A nonmagical wall of solid stone springs into existence at a point you
    choose within range. The wall is 6 inches thick and is composed of ten 10-foot-by10-foot
    panels. Each panel must be contiguous with another panel. Alternatively, you can
    create 10-foot-by-20-foot panels that are only 3 inches thick.


    If the wall cuts through a creature’s space when it appears, the creature is pushed
    to one side of the wall (you choose which side). If a creature would be surrounded
    on all sides by the wall (or the wall and another solid surface), that creature
    can make a Dexterity saving throw. On a success, it can use its Reaction to move
    up to its Speed so that it is no longer enclosed by the wall.


    The wall can have any shape you desire, though it can’t occupy the same space
    as a creature or object. The wall doesn’t need to be vertical or rest on a firm
    foundation. It must, however, merge with and be solidly supported by existing
    stone. Thus, you can use this spell to bridge a chasm or create a ramp.


    If you create a span greater than 20 feet in length, you must halve the size of
    each panel to create supports. You can crudely shape the wall to create battlements
    and the like.


    The wall is an object made of stone that can be damaged and thus breached. Each
    panel has AC 15 and 30 Hit Points per inch of thickness, and it has Immunity to
    Poison and Psychic damage. Reducing a panel to 0 Hit Points destroys it and might
    cause connected panels to collapse at the GM’s discretion.


    If you maintain your Concentration on this spell for its full duration, the wall
    becomes permanent and can’t be dispelled. Otherwise, the wall disappears when
    the spell ends.'
