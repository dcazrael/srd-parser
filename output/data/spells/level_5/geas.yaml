description: 'You give a verbal command to a creature that you can see within range,
    ordering it to carry out some service or refrain from an action or a course of
    activity as you decide. The target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or have
    the Charmed condition for the duration. The target automatically succeeds if it
    canâ€™t understand your command.


    While Charmed, the creature takes 5d10 Psychic damage if it acts in a manner directly
    counter to your command. It takes this damage no more than once each day.


    You can issue any command you choose, short of an activity that would result in
    certain death. Should you issue a suicidal command, the spell ends.


    A Remove Curse, Greater Restoration, or Wish spell ends this spell. '
