description: 'A passage appears at a point that you can see on a wooden, plaster,
    or stone surface (such as a wall, ceiling, or floor) within range and lasts for
    the duration. You choose the openingâ€™s dimensions: up to 5 feet wide, 8 feet tall,
    and 20 feet deep. The passage creates no instability in a structure surrounding
    it.


    When the opening disappears, any creatures or objects still in the passage created
    by the spell are safely ejected to an unoccupied space nearest to the surface
    on which you cast the spell.'
