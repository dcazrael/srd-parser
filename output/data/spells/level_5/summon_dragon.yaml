description: 'You call forth a Dragon spirit. It manifests in an unoccupied space
    that you can see within range and uses the Draconic Spirit stat block. The creature
    disappears when it drops to 0 Hit Points or when the spell ends.


    The creature is an ally to you and your allies. In combat, the creature shares
    your Initiative count, but it takes its turn immediately after yours. It obeys
    your verbal commands (no action required by you). If you don’t issue any, it takes
    the Dodge action and uses its movement to avoid danger. '
