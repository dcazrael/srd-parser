description: 'You pull wisps of shadow material from the Shadowfell to create an object
    within range. It is either an object of vegetable matter (soft goods, rope, wood,
    and the like) or mineral matter (stone, crystal, metal, and the like). The object
    must be no larger than a 5-foot Cube, and the object must be of a form and material
    that you have seen.


    The spell’s duration depends on the object’s material, as shown in the Materials
    table. If the object is composed of multiple materials, use the shortest duration.
    Using any object created by this spell as another spell’s Material component causes
    the other spell to fail.


    ###### Materials


    | Material              | Duration   | |-----------------------|------------|
    | Vegetable matter      | 24 hours   | | Stone or crystal      | 12 hours   |
    | Precious metals       | 1 hour     | | Gems                  | 10 minutes |
    | Adamantine or mithral | 1 minute   | '
