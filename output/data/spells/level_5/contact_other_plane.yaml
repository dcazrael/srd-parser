description: 'You mentally contact a demigod, the spirit of a long dead sage, or some
    other knowledgeable entity from another plane. Contacting this otherworldly intelligence
    can break your mind. When you cast this spell, make a DC 15 Intelligence saving
    throw. On a successful save, you can ask the entity up to five questions. You
    must ask your questions before the spell ends. The GM answers each question with
    one word, such as “yes,” “no,” “maybe,” “never,” “irrelevant,” or “unclear” (if
    the entity doesn’t know the answer to the question). If a one-word answer would
    be misleading, the GM might instead offer a short phrase as an answer.


    On a failed save, you take 6d6 Psychic damage and have the Incapacitated condition
    until you finish a Long Rest. A Greater Restoration spell cast on you ends this
    effect.'
