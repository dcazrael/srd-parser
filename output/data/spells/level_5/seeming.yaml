description: 'You give an illusory appearance to each creature of your choice that
    you can see within range. An unwilling target can make a Charisma saving throw,
    and if it succeeds, it is unaffected by this spell.


    You can give the same appearance or different ones to the targets. The spell can
    change the appearance of the targets’ bodies and equipment. You can make each
    creature seem 1 foot shorter or taller and appear heavier or lighter. A target’s
    new appearance must have the same basic arrangement of limbs as the target, but
    the extent of the illusion is otherwise up to you. The spell lasts for the duration.


    The changes wrought by this spell fail to hold up to physical inspection. For
    example, if you use this spell to add a hat to a creature’s outfit, objects pass
    through the hat.


    A creature that takes the Study action to examine a target can make an Intelligence
    (Investigation) check against your spell save DC. If it succeeds, it becomes aware
    that the target is disguised.'
