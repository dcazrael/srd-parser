description: 'You target a creature you know on the same plane of existence. You or
    a willing creature you touch enters a trance state to act as a dream messenger.
    While in the trance, the messenger is Incapacitated and has a Speed of 0.


    If the target is asleep, the messenger appears in the target’s dreams and can
    converse with the target as long as it remains asleep, through the spell’s duration.
    The messenger can also shape the dream’s environment, creating landscapes, objects,
    and other images. The messenger can emerge from the trance at any time, ending
    the spell. The target recalls the dream perfectly upon waking.


    If the target is awake when you cast the spell, the messenger knows it and can
    either end the trance (and the spell) or wait for the target to sleep, at which
    point the messenger enters its dreams.


    You can make the messenger terrifying to the target. If you do so, the messenger
    can deliver a message of no more than ten words, and then the target makes a Wisdom
    saving throw. On a failed save, the target gains no benefit from its rest, and
    it takes 3d6 Psychic damage when it wakes up.'
