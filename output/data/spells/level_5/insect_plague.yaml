description: 'Swarming locusts fill a 20-foot-radius Sphere centered on a point you
    choose within range. The Sphere remains for the duration, and its area is Lightly
    Obscured and Difficult Terrain.


    When the swarm appears, each creature in it makes a Constitution saving throw,
    taking 4d10 Piercing damage on a failed save or half as much damage on a successful
    one. A creature also makes this save when it enters the spellâ€™s area for the first
    time on a turn or ends its turn there. A creature makes this save only once per
    turn. '
