description: 'You touch one Large or smaller object that isnâ€™t being worn or carried
    by someone else. Until the spell ends, the object sheds Bright Light in a 20-foot
    radius and Dim Light for an additional 20 feet. The light can be colored as you
    like.


    Covering the object with something opaque blocks the light. The spell ends if
    you cast it again.'
