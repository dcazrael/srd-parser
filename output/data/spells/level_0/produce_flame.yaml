description: 'A flickering flame appears in your hand and remains there for the duration.
    While there, the flame emits no heat and ignites nothing, and it sheds Bright
    Light in a 20-foot radius and Dim Light for an additional 20 feet. The spell ends
    if you cast it again.


    Until the spell ends, you can take a Magic action to hurl fire at a creature or
    an object within 60 feet of you. Make a ranged spell attack. On a hit, the target
    takes 1d8 Fire damage. '
