description: 'This spell repairs a single break or tear in an object you touch, such
    as a broken chain link, two halves of a broken key, a torn cloak, or a leaking
    wineskin. As long as the break or tear is no larger than 1 foot in any dimension,
    you mend it, leaving no trace of the former damage.


    This spell can physically repair a magic item, but it canâ€™t restore magic to such
    an object.'
