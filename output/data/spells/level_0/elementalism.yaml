-   name: Beckon Air
    text: You create a breeze strong enough to ripple cloth, stir dust, rustle leaves,
        and close open doors and shutters, all in a 5-foot Cube. Doors and shutters
        being held open by someone or something aren’t affected.
-   name: Beckon Earth
    text: You create a thin shroud of dust or sand that covers surfaces in a 5-foot-square
        area, or you cause a single word to appear in your handwriting in a patch
        of dirt or sand.
-   name: Beckon Fire
    text: You create a thin cloud of harmless embers and colored, scented smoke in
        a 5-foot Cube. You choose the color and scent, and the embers can light candles,
        torches, or lamps in that area. The smoke’s scent lingers for 1 minute.
-   name: Beckon Water
    text: You create a spray of cool mist that lightly dampens creatures and objects
        in a 5-foot Cube. Alternatively, you create 1 cup of clean water either in
        an open container or on a surface, and the water evaporates in 1 minute.
-   name: Sculpt Element
    text: You cause dirt, sand, fire, smoke, mist, or water that can fit in a 1-foot
        Cube to assume a crude shape (such as that of a creature) for 1 hour.
