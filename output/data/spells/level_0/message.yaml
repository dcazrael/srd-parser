description: 'You point toward a creature within range and whisper a message. The
    target (and only the target) hears the message and can reply in a whisper that
    only you can hear.


    You can cast this spell through solid objects if you are familiar with the target
    and know it is beyond the barrier. Magical silence; 1 foot of stone, metal, or
    wood; or a thin sheet of lead blocks the spell.'
