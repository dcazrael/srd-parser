description: 'Until the spell ends, one willing creature you touch is protected against
    creatures that are Aberrations, Celestials, Elementals, Fey, Fiends, or Undead.


    The protection grants several benefits. Creatures of those types have Disadvantage
    on attack rolls against the target. The target also canâ€™t be possessed by or gain
    the Charmed or Frightened conditions from them. If the target is already possessed,
    Charmed, or Frightened by such a creature, the target has Advantage on any new
    saving throw against the relevant effect.'
