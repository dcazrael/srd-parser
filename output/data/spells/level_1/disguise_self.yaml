description: 'You make yourself — including your clothing, armor, weapons, and other
    belongings on your person— look different until the spell ends. You can seem


    1 foot shorter or taller and can appear heavier or lighter. You must adopt a form
    that has the same basic arrangement of limbs as you have. Otherwise, the extent
    of the illusion is up to you.


    The changes wrought by this spell fail to hold up to physical inspection. For
    example, if you use this spell to add a hat to your outfit, objects pass through
    the hat, and anyone who touches it would feel nothing.


    To discern that you are disguised, a creature must take the Study action to inspect
    your appearance and succeed on an Intelligence (Investigation) check against your
    spell save DC.'
