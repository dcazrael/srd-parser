description: 'You gain the service of a familiar, a spirit that takes an animal form
    you choose: **Bat**, **Cat**, **Frog**, **Hawk**, **Lizard**, **Octopus**, **Owl**,
    **Rat**, **Raven**, **Spider**, **Weasel**, or another Beast that has a Challenge
    Rating of 0.


    Appearing in an unoccupied space within range, the familiar has the statistics
    of the chosen form (see “Monsters”), though it is a Celestial, Fey, or Fiend (your
    choice) instead of a Beast. Your familiar acts independently of you, but it obeys
    your commands. '

-   name: Telepathic Connection
    text: While your familiar is within 100 feet of you, you can communicate with
        it telepathically. Additionally, as a Bonus Action, you can see through the
        familiar’s eyes and hear what it hears until the start of your next turn,
        gaining the benefits of any special senses it has.  Finally, when you cast
        a spell with a range of touch, your familiar can deliver the touch. Your familiar
        must be within 100 feet of you, and it must take a Reaction to deliver the
        touch when you cast the spell.
-   name: Combat
    text: The familiar is an ally to you and your allies. It rolls its own Initiative
        and acts on its own turn. A familiar can’t attack, but it can take other actions
        as normal.
-   name: Disappearance of the Familiar
    text: When the familiar drops to 0 Hit Points, it disappears. It reappears after
        you cast this spell again. As a Magic action, you can temporarily dismiss
        the familiar to a pocket dimension. Alternatively, you can dismiss it forever.
        As a Magic action while it is temporarily dismissed, you can cause it to reappear
        in an unoccupied space within 30 feet of you. Whenever the familiar drops
        to 0 Hit Points or disappears into the pocket dimension, it leaves behind
        in its space anything it was wearing or carrying.
-   name: One Familiar Only
    text: You can’t have more than one familiar at a time. If you cast this spell
        while you have a familiar, you instead cause it to adopt a new eligible form.
