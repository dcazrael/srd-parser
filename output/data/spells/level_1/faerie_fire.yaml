description: 'Objects in a 20-foot Cube within range are outlined in blue, green,
    or violet light (your choice). Each creature in the Cube is also outlined if it
    fails a Dexterity saving throw. For the duration, objects and affected creatures
    shed Dim Light in a 10-foot radius and canâ€™t benefit from the Invisible condition.


    Attack rolls against an affected creature or object have Advantage if the attacker
    can see it.'
