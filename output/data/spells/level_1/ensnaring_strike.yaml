description: 'As you hit the target, grasping vines appear on it, and it makes a Strength
    saving throw. A Large or larger creature has Advantage on this save. On a failed
    save, the target has the Restrained condition until the spell ends. On a successful
    save, the vines shrivel away, and the spell ends.


    While Restrained, the target takes 1d6 Piercing damage at the start of each of
    its turns. The target or a creature within reach of it can take an action to make
    a Strength (Athletics) check against your spell save DC. On a success, the spell
    ends. '
