description: 'You hurl an orb of energy at a target within range. Choose Acid, Cold,
    Fire, Lightning, Poison, or Thunder for the type of orb you create, and then make
    a ranged spell attack against the target. On a hit, the target takes 3d8 damage
    of the chosen type.


    If you roll the same number on two or more of the d8s, the orb leaps to a different
    target of your choice within 30 feet of the target. Make an attack roll against
    the new target, and make a new damage roll. The orb canâ€™t leap again unless you
    cast the spell with a level 2+ spell slot. '

        leap a maximum number of times equal to the level of the slot expended, and
        a creature can be targeted only once by each casting of this spell.
