description: 'For the duration, you sense the presence of magical effects within 30
    feet of yourself. If you sense such effects, you can take the Magic action to
    see a faint aura around any visible creature or object in the area that bears
    the magic, and if an effect was created by a spell, you learn the spellâ€™s school
    of magic.


    The spell is blocked by 1 foot of stone, dirt, or wood; 1 inch of metal; or a
    thin sheet of lead.'
