description: 'This spell creates an Invisible, mindless, shapeless, Medium force that
    performs simple tasks at your command until the spell ends. The servant springs
    into existence in an unoccupied space on the ground within range. It has AC 10,
    1 Hit Point, and a Strength of 2, and it canâ€™t attack. If it drops to 0 Hit Points,
    the spell ends.


    Once on each of your turns as a Bonus Action, you can mentally command the servant
    to move up to 15 feet and interact with an object. The servant can perform simple
    tasks that a human could do, such as fetching things, cleaning, mending, folding
    clothes, lighting fires, serving food, and pouring drinks.


    Once you give the command, the servant performs the task to the best of its ability
    until it completes the task, then waits for your next command.


    If you command the servant to perform a task that would move it more than 60 feet
    away from you, the spell ends.'
