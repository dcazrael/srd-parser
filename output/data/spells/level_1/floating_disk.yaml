description: 'This spell creates a circular, horizontal plane of force, 3 feet in
    diameter and 1 inch thick, that floats 3 feet above the ground in an unoccupied
    space of your choice that you can see within range. The disk remains for the duration
    and can hold up to 500 pounds. If more weight is placed on it, the spell ends,
    and everything on the disk falls to the ground.


    The disk is immobile while you are within 20 feet of it. If you move more than
    20 feet away from it, the disk follows you so that it remains within 20 feet of
    you. It can move across uneven terrain, up or down stairs, slopes and the like,
    but it can’t cross an elevation change of 10 feet or more. For example, the disk
    can’t move across a 10-foot-deep pit, nor could it leave such a pit if it was
    created at the bottom.


    If you move more than 100 feet from the disk (typically because it can’t move
    around an obstacle to follow you), the spell ends.'
