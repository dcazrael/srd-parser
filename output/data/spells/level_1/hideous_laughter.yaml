description: 'One creature of your choice that you can see within range makes a Wisdom
    saving throw. On a failed save, it has the Prone and Incapacitated conditions
    for the duration. During that time, it laughs uncontrollably if it’s capable of
    laughter, and it can’t end the Prone condition on itself.


    At the end of each of its turns and each time it takes damage, it makes another
    Wisdom saving throw. The target has Advantage on the save if the save is triggered
    by damage. On a successful save, the spell ends. '
