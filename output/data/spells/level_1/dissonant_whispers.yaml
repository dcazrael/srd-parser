description: 'One creature of your choice that you can see within range hears a discordant
    melody in its mind. The target makes a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save,
    it takes 3d6 Psychic damage and must immediately use its Reaction, if available,
    to move as far away from you as it can, using the safest route. On a successful
    save, the target takes half as much damage only. '
