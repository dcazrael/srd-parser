description: 'Ten berries appear in your hand and are infused with magic for the duration.
    A creature can take a Bonus Action to eat one berry. Eating a berry restores 1
    Hit Point, and the berry provides enough nourishment to sustain a creature for
    one day.


    Uneaten berries disappear when the spell ends.'
