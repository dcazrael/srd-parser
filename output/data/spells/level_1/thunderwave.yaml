description: 'You unleash a wave of thunderous energy. Each creature in a 15-foot
    Cube originating from you makes a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save,
    a creature takes 2d8 Thunder damage and is pushed 10 feet away from you. On a
    successful save, a creature takes half as much damage only.


    In addition, unsecured objects that are entirely within the Cube are pushed 10
    feet away from you, and a thunderous boom is audible within 300 feet. '
