description: 'You convert raw materials into products of the same material. For example,
    you can fabricate a wooden bridge from a clump of trees, a rope from a patch of
    hemp, or clothes from flax or wool.


    Choose raw materials that you can see within range. You can fabricate a Large
    or smaller object (contained within a 10-foot Cube or eight connected 5-foot Cubes)
    given a sufficient quantity of material. If you’re working with metal, stone,
    or another mineral substance, however, the fabricated object can be no larger
    than Medium (contained within a 5-foot Cube). The quality of any fabricated objects
    is based on the quality of the raw materials.


    Creatures and magic items can’t be created by this spell. You also can’t use it
    to create items that require a high degree of skill — such as weapons and armor
    — unless you have proficiency with the type of Artisan’s Tools used to craft such
    objects.'
