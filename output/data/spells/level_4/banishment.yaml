description: 'One creature that you can see within range must succeed on a Charisma
    saving throw or be transported to a harmless demiplane for the duration. While
    there, the target has the Incapacitated condition. When the spell ends, the target
    reappears in the space it left or in the nearest unoccupied space if that space
    is occupied.


    If the target is an Aberration, a Celestial, an Elemental, a Fey, or a Fiend,
    the target doesn’t return if the spell lasts for 1 minute. The target is instead
    transported to a random location on a plane (GM’s choice) associated with its
    creature type. '
