description: 'You make natural terrain in a 150-foot Cube in range look, sound, and
    smell like another sort of natural terrain. Thus, open fields or a road can be
    made to resemble a swamp, hill, crevasse, or some other difficult or impassable
    terrain. A pond can be made to seem like a grassy meadow, a precipice like a gentle
    slope, or a rock-strewn gully like a wide and smooth road. Manufactured structures,
    equipment, and creatures within the area aren’t changed.


    The tactile characteristics of the terrain are unchanged, so creatures entering
    the area are likely to notice the illusion. If the difference isn’t obvious by
    touch, a creature examining the illusion can take the Study action to make an
    Intelligence (Investigation) check against your spell save DC to disbelieve it.
    If a creature discerns that the terrain is illusory, the creature sees a vague
    image superimposed on the real terrain.'
