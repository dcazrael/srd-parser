description: 'Squirming, ebony tentacles fill a 20-foot square on ground that you
    can see within range. For the duration, these tentacles turn the ground in that
    area into Difficult Terrain.


    Each creature in that area makes a Strength saving throw. On a failed save, it
    takes 3d6 Bludgeoning damage, and it has the Restrained condition until the spell
    ends. A creature also makes that save if it enters the area or ends it turn there.
    A creature makes that save only once per turn.


    A Restrained creature can take an action to make a Strength (Athletics) check
    against your spell save DC, ending the condition on itself on a success.'
