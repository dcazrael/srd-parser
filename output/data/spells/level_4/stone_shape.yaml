description: You touch a stone object of Medium size or smaller or a section of stone
    no more than 5 feet in any dimension and form it into any shape you like. For
    example, you could shape a large rock into a weapon, statue, or coffer, or you
    could make a small passage through a wall that is 5 feet thick. You could also
    shape a stone door or its frame to seal the door shut. The object you create can
    have up to two hinges and a latch, but finer mechanical detail isnâ€™t possible.
