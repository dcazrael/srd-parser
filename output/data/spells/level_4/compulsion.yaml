description: 'Each creature of your choice that you can see within range must succeed
    on a Wisdom saving throw or have the Charmed condition until the spell ends.


    For the duration, you can take a Bonus Action to designate a direction that is
    horizontal to you. Each Charmed target must use as much of its movement as possible
    to move in that direction on its next turn, taking the safest route. After moving
    in this way, a target repeats the save, ending the spell on itself on a success.'
