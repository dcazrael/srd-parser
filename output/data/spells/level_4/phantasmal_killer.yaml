description: 'You tap into the nightmares of a creature you can see within range and
    create an illusion of its deepest fears, visible only to that creature. The target
    makes a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the target takes 4d10 Psychic damage
    and has Disadvantage on ability checks and attack rolls for the duration. On a
    successful save, the target takes half as much damage, and the spell ends.


    For the duration, the target makes a Wisdom saving throw at the end of each of
    its turns. On a failed save, it takes the Psychic damage again. On a successful
    save, the spell ends. '
