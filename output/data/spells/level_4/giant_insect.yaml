description: 'You summon a giant centipede, spider, or wasp (chosen when you cast
    the spell). It manifests in an unoccupied space you can see within range and uses
    the Giant Insect stat block. The form you choose determines certain details in
    its stat block. The creature disappears when it drops to 0 Hit Points or when
    the spell ends.


    The creature is an ally to you and your allies. In combat, the creature shares
    your Initiative count, but it takes its turn immediately after yours. It obeys
    your verbal commands (no action required by you). If you don’t issue any, it takes
    the Dodge action and uses its movement to avoid danger. '
