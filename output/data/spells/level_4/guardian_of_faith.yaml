description: 'A Large spectral guardian appears and hovers for the duration in an
    unoccupied space that you can see within range. The guardian occupies that space
    and is invulnerable, and it appears in a form appropriate for your deity or pantheon.


    Any enemy that moves to a space within 10 feet of the guardian for the first time
    on a turn or starts its turn there makes a Dexterity saving throw, taking 20 Radiant
    damage on a failed save or half as much damage on a successful one. The guardian
    vanishes when it has dealt a total of 60 damage.'
