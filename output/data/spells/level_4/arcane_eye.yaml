description: 'You create an Invisible, invulnerable eye within range that hovers for
    the duration. You mentally receive visual information from the eye, which can
    see in every direction. It also has Darkvision with a range of 30 feet.


    As a Bonus Action, you can move the eye up to 30 feet in any direction. A solid
    barrier blocks the eyeâ€™s movement, but the eye can pass through an opening as
    small as 1 inch in diameter.'
