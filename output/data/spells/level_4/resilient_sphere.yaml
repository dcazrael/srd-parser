description: 'A shimmering sphere encloses a Large or smaller creature or object within
    range. An unwilling creature must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or be enclosed
    for the duration.


    Nothing — not physical objects, energy, or other spell effects — can pass through
    the barrier, in or out, though a creature in the sphere can breathe there. The
    sphere is immune to all damage, and a creature or object inside can’t be damaged
    by attacks or effects originating from outside, nor can a creature inside the
    sphere damage anything outside it.


    The sphere is weightless and just large enough to contain the creature or object
    inside. An enclosed creature can take an action to push against the sphere’s walls
    and thus roll the sphere at up to half the creature’s Speed. Similarly, the globe
    can be picked up and moved by other creatures.


    A Disintegrate spell targeting the globe destroys it without harming anything
    inside.'
