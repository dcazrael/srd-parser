description: 'You conjure nature spirits that flit around you in a 10-foot Emanation
    for the duration. Whenever the Emanation enters the space of a creature you can
    see and whenever a creature you can see enters the Emanation or ends its turn
    there, you can force that creature to make a Wisdom saving throw. The creature
    takes 5d8 Force damage on a failed save or half as much damage on a successful
    one. A creature makes this save only once per turn.


    In addition, you can take the Disengage action as a Bonus Action for the spellâ€™s
    duration. '
