description: "Each creature in a 10-foot-radius Sphere centered on a point you choose\
    \ within range must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw, or that target can’t take\
    \ Bonus Actions or Reactions and must roll 1d10 at the start of each of its turns\
    \ to determine its behavior for that turn, consulting the table below.\n\n| 1d10\
