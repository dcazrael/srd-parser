description: 'You point at a location within range, and a glowing, 1-foot-diameter
    ball of acid streaks there and explodes in a 20-foot-radius Sphere. Each creature
    in that area makes a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes
    10d4 Acid damage and another 5d4 Acid damage at the end of its next turn. On a
    successful save, a creature takes half the initial damage only. '
