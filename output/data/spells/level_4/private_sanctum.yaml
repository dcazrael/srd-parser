description: 'You make an area within range magically secure. The area is a Cube that
    can be as small as 5 feet to as large as 100 feet on each side. The spell lasts
    for the duration.


    When you cast the spell, you decide what sort of security the spell provides,
    choosing any of the following properties:


    - Sound can’t pass through the barrier at the edge of the warded area. - The barrier
    of the warded area appears dark and foggy, preventing vision (including Darkvision)
    through it. - Sensors created by Divination spells can’t appear inside the protected
    area or pass through the barrier at its   perimeter. - Creatures in the area can’t
    be targeted by Divination spells. - Nothing can teleport into or out of the warded
    area. - Planar travel is blocked within the warded area.


    Casting this spell on the same spot every day for 365 days makes the spell last
    until dispelled. '
