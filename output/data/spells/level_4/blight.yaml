description: 'A creature that you can see within range makes a Constitution saving
    throw, taking 8d8 Necrotic damage on a failed save or half as much damage on a
    successful one. A Plant creature automatically fails the save.


    Alternatively, target a nonmagical plant that isn’t a creature, such as a tree
    or shrub. It doesn’t make a save; it simply withers and dies. '
