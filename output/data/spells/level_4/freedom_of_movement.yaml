description: 'You touch a willing creature. For the duration, the target’s movement
    is unaffected by Difficult Terrain, and spells and other magical effects can neither
    reduce the target’s Speed nor cause the target to have the Paralyzed or Restrained
    conditions. The target also has a Swim Speed equal to its Speed. In addition,
    the target can spend 5 feet of movement to automatically escape from nonmagical
    restraints, such as manacles or a creature imposing the Grappled condition on
    it. '
