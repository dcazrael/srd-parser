description: 'Blazing orbs of fire plummet to the ground at four different points
    you can see within range. Each creature in a 40-foot-radius Sphere centered on
    each of those points makes a Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes 20d6 Fire
    damage and 20d6 Bludgeoning damage on a failed save or half as much damage on
    a successful one. A creature in the area of more than one fiery Sphere is affected
    only once.


    A nonmagical object that isn’t being worn or carried also takes the damage if
    it’s in the spell’s area, and the object starts burning if it’s flammable.'
