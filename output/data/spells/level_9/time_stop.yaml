description: 'You briefly stop the flow of time for everyone but yourself. No time
    passes for other creatures, while you take 1d4 + 1 turns in a row, during which
    you can use actions and move as normal.


    This spell ends if one of the actions you use during this period, or any effects
    that you create during it, affects a creature other than you or an object being
    worn or carried by someone other than you. In addition, the spell ends if you
    move to a place more than 1,000 feet from the location where you cast it.'
