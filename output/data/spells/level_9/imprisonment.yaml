description: 'You create a magical restraint to hold a creature that you can see within
    range. The target must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a successful save, the target
    is unaffected, and it is immune to this spell for the next 24 hours. On a failed
    save, the target is imprisoned. While imprisoned, the target doesn’t need to breathe,
    eat, or drink, and it doesn’t age. Divination spells can’t locate or perceive
    the imprisoned target, and the target can’t teleport.


    Until the spell ends, the target is also affected by one of the following effects
    of your choice: '

subsections:
-   name: Burial
    text: The target is entombed beneath the earth in a hollow globe of magical force
        that is just large enough to contain the target. Nothing can pass into or
        out of the globe.
-   name: Chaining
    text: Chains firmly rooted in the ground hold the target in place. The target
        has the Restrained condition and can’t be moved by any means.
-   name: Hedged Prison
    text: The target is trapped in a demiplane that is warded against teleportation
        and planar travel. The demiplane is your choice of a labyrinth, a cage, a
        tower, or the like.  **Minimus Containment.** The target becomes 1 inch tall
        and is trapped inside an indestructible gemstone or a similar object. Light
        can pass through the gemstone (allowing the target to see out and other creatures
        to see in), but nothing else can pass through by any means.
-   name: Slumber
    text: The target has the Unconscious condition and can’t be awoken.
-   name: Ending the Spell
    text: When you cast the spell, specify a trigger that will end it. The trigger
        can be as simple or as elaborate as you choose, but the GM must agree that
        it has a high likelihood of happening within the next decade. The trigger
        must be an observable action, such as someone making a particular offering
        at the temple of your god, saving your true love, or defeating a specific
        monster.  A Dispel Magic spell can end the spell only if it is cast with a
        level 9 spell slot, targeting either the prison or the component used to create
        it.
