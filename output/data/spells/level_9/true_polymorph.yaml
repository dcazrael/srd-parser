description: 'Choose one creature or nonmagical object that you can see within range.
    The creature shape-shifts into a different creature or a nonmagical object, or
    the object shape-shifts into a creature (the object must be neither worn nor carried).
    The transformation lasts for the duration or until the target dies or is destroyed,
    but if you maintain Concentration on this spell for the full duration, the spell
    lasts until dispelled.


    An unwilling creature can make a Wisdom saving throw, and if it succeeds, it isn’t
    affected by this spell. '

-   name: Creature into Creature
    text: If you turn a creature into another kind of creature, the new form can be
        any kind you choose that has a Challenge Rating equal to or less than the
        target’s Challenge Rating or level. The target’s game statistics are replaced
        by the stat block of the new form, but it retains its Hit Points, Hit Point
        Dice, alignment, and personality.  The target gains a number of Temporary
        Hit Points equal to the Hit Points of the new form. These Temporary Hit Points
        vanish if any remain when the spell ends.  The target is limited in the actions
        it can perform by the anatomy of its new form, and it can’t speak or cast
        spells.  The target’s gear melds into the new form. The creature can’t use
        or otherwise benefit from any of that equipment.
-   name: Object into Creature
    text: You can turn an object into any kind of creature, as long as the creature’s
        size is no larger than the object’s size and the creature has a Challenge
        Rating of 9 or lower. The creature is Friendly to you and your allies. In
        combat, it takes its turns immediately after yours, and it obeys your commands.  If
        the spell lasts more than an hour, you no longer control the creature. It
        might remain Friendly to you, depending on how you have treated it.
-   name: Creature into Object
    text: If you turn a creature into an object, it transforms along with whatever
        it is wearing and carrying into that form, as long as the object’s size is
        no larger than the creature’s size. The creature’s statistics become those
        of the object, and the creature has no memory of time spent in this form after
        the spell ends and it returns to normal.
