description: 'A shimmering, multicolored plane of light forms a vertical opaque wall
    — up to 90 feet long, 30 feet high, and 1 inch thick — centered on a point within
    range. Alternatively, you shape the wall into a globe up to 30 feet in diameter
    centered on a point within range. The wall lasts for the duration. If you position
    the wall in a space occupied by a creature, the spell ends instantly without effect.


    The wall sheds Bright Light within 100 feet and Dim Light for an additional 100
    feet. You and creatures you designate when you cast the spell can pass through
    and be near the wall without harm. If another creature that can see the wall moves
    within 20 feet of it or starts its turn there, the creature must succeed on a
    Constitution saving throw or have the Blinded condition for 1 minute.


    The wall consists of seven layers, each with a different color. When a creature
    reaches into or passes through the wall, it does so one layer at a time through
    all the layers. Each layer forces the creature to make a Dexterity saving throw
    or be affected by that layer’s properties as described in the Prismatic Layers
    table.


    The wall, which has AC 10, can be destroyed one layer at a time, in order from
    red to violet, by means specific to each layer. If a layer is destroyed, it is
    gone for the duration. Antimagic Field has no effect on the wall, and Dispel Magic
    can affect only the violet layer.
