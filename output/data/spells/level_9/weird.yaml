description: 'You try to create illusory terrors in othersâ€™ minds. Each creature of
    your choice in a 30-foot-radius Sphere centered on a point within range makes
    a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, a target takes 10d10 Psychic damage and
    has the Frightened condition for the duration. On a successful save, a target
    takes half as much damage only.


    A Frightened target makes a Wisdom saving throw at the end of each of its turns.
    On a failed save, it takes 5d10 Psychic damage. On a successful save, the spell
    ends on that target.'
