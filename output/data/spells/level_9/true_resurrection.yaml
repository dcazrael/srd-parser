description: 'which the spell consumes)


    **Duration**: Instantaneous


    You touch a creature that has been dead for no longer than 200 years and that
    died for any reason except old age. The creature is revived with all its Hit Points.


    This spell closes all wounds, neutralizes any poison, cures all magical contagions,
    and lifts any curses affecting the creature when it died. The spell replaces damaged
    or missing organs and limbs.


    If the creature was Undead, it is restored to its non-Undead form.


    The spell can provide a new body if the original no longer exists, in which case
    you must speak the creatureâ€™s name. The creature then appears in an unoccupied
    space you choose within 10 feet of you.'
