description: 'You conjure a portal linking an unoccupied space you can see within
    range to a precise location on a different plane of existence. The portal is a
    circular opening, which you can make 5 to 20 feet in diameter. You can orient
    the portal in any direction you choose. The portal lasts for the duration, and
    the portal’s destination is visible through it.


    The portal has a front and a back on each plane where it appears. Travel through
    the portal is possible only by moving through its front. Anything that does so
    is instantly transported to the other plane, appearing in the unoccupied space
    nearest to the portal.


    Deities and other planar rulers can prevent portals created by this spell from
    opening in their presence or anywhere within their domains.


    When you cast this spell, you can speak the name of a specific creature (a pseudonym,
    title, or nickname doesn’t work). If that creature is on a plane other than the
    one you are on, the portal opens next to the named creature and transports it
    to the nearest unoccupied space on your side of the portal. You gain no special
    power over the creature, and it is free to act as the GM deems appropriate. It
    might leave, attack you, or help you.'
