description: 'You shape-shift into another creature for the duration or until you
    take a Magic action to shape-shift into a different eligible form. The new form
    must be of a creature that has a Challenge Rating no higher than your level or
    Challenge Rating. You must have seen the sort of creature before, and it can’t
    be a Construct or an Undead.


    When you cast the spell, you gain a number of Temporary Hit Points equal to the
    Hit Points of the first form into which you shape-shift. These Temporary Hit Points
    vanish if any remain when the spell ends.


    Your game statistics are replaced by the stat block of the chosen form, but you
    retain your creature type; alignment; personality; Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma
    scores; Hit Points; Hit Point Dice; proficiencies; and ability to communicate.
    If you have the Spellcasting feature, you retain it too.


    Upon shape-shifting, you determine whether your equipment drops to the ground
    or changes in size and shape to fit the new form while you’re in it.'
