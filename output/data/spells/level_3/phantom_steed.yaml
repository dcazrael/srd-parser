description: 'A Large, quasi-real, horse-like creature appears on the ground in an
    unoccupied space of your choice within range. You decide the creature’s appearance,
    and it is equipped with a saddle, bit, and bridle. Any of the equipment created
    by the spell vanishes in a puff of smoke if it is carried more than 10 feet away
    from the steed.


    For the duration, you or a creature you choose can ride the steed. The steed uses
    the Riding Horse stat block (see “Monsters”), except it has a Speed of 100 feet
    and can travel 13 miles in an hour. When the spell ends, the steed gradually fades,
    giving the rider 1 minute to dismount. The spell ends early if the steed takes
    any damage.'
