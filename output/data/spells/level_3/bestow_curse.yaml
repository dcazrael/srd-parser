-   name: Choose one ability
    text: The target has Disadvantage on ability checks and saving throws made with
        that ability.  The target has Disadvantage on attack rolls against you.  In
        combat, the target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw at the start of each
        of its turns or be forced to take the Dodge action on that turn.  If you deal
        damage to the target with an attack roll or a spell, the target takes an extra
        1d8 Necrotic damage.
-   name: Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot
    text: If you cast this spell using a level 4 spell slot, you can maintain Concentration
        on it for up to 10 minutes. If you use a level 5+ spell slot, the spell doesn’t
        require Concentration, and the duration becomes 8 hours (level 5–6 slot) or
        24 hours (level 7–8 slot). If you use a level 9 spell slot, the spell lasts
        until dispelled.
