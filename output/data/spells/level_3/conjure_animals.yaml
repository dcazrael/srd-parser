description: 'You conjure nature spirits that appear as a Large pack of spectral,
    intangible animals in an unoccupied space you can see within range. The pack lasts
    for the duration, and you choose the spirits’ animal form, such as wolves, serpents,
    or birds.


    You have Advantage on Strength saving throws while you’re within 5 feet of the
    pack, and when you move on your turn, you can also move the pack up to 30 feet
    to an unoccupied space you can see.


    Whenever the pack moves within 10 feet of a creature you can see and whenever
    a creature you can see enters a space within 10 feet of the pack or ends its turn
    there, you can force that creature to make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed
    save, the creature takes 3d10 Slashing damage. A creature makes this save only
    once per turn. '
