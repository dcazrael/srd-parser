description: 'You create a twisting pattern of colors in a 30-foot Cube within range.
    The pattern appears for a moment and vanishes. Each creature in the area who can
    see the pattern must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or have the Charmed condition
    for the duration. While Charmed, the creature has the Incapacitated condition
    and a Speed of 0.


    The spell ends for an affected creature if it takes any damage or if someone else
    uses an action to shake the creature out of its stupor.'
