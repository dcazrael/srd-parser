description: You create 45 pounds of food and 30 gallons of fresh water on the ground
    or in containers within range â€” both useful in fending off the hazards of malnutrition
    and dehydration. The food is bland but nourishing and looks like a food of your
    choice, and the water is clean. The food spoils after 24 hours if uneaten.
