description: 'Choose a pile of bones or a corpse of a Medium or Small Humanoid within
    range. The target becomes an Undead creature: a Skeleton if you chose bones or
    a Zombie if you chose a corpse (see “Monsters” for the stat blocks).


    On each of your turns, you can take a Bonus Action to mentally command any creature
    you made with this spell if the creature is within 60 feet of you (if you control
    multiple creatures, you can command any of them at the same time, issuing the
    same command to each one). You decide what action the creature will take and where
    it will move on its next turn, or you can issue a general command, such as to
    guard a chamber or corridor. If you issue no commands, the creature takes the
    Dodge action and moves only to avoid harm. Once given an order, the creature continues
    to follow it until its task is complete.


    The creature is under your control for 24 hours, after which it stops obeying
    any command you’ve given it. To maintain control of the creature for another 24
    hours, you must cast this spell on the creature again before the current 24-hour
    period ends. This use of the spell reasserts your control over up to four creatures
    you have animated with this spell rather than animating a new creature. '
