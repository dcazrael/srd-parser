description: 'You create a 20-foot-radius Sphere of yellow, nauseating gas centered
    on a point within range. The cloud is Heavily Obscured. The cloud lingers in the
    air for the duration or until a strong wind (such as the one created by Gust of
    Wind) disperses it.


    Each creature that starts its turn in the Sphere must succeed on a Constitution
    saving throw or have the Poisoned condition until the end of the current turn.
    While Poisoned in this way, the creature canâ€™t take an action or a Bonus Action.'
