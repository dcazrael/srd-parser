description: 'You create an Invisible sensor within range in a location familiar to
    you (a place you have visited or seen before) or in an obvious location that is
    unfamiliar to you (such as behind a door, around a corner, or in a grove of trees).
    The intangible, invulnerable sensor remains in place for the duration.


    When you cast the spell, choose seeing or hearing. You can use the chosen sense
    through the sensor as if you were in its space. As a Bonus Action, you can switch
    between seeing and hearing.


    A creature that sees the sensor (such as a creature benefiting from See Invisibility
    or Truesight) sees a luminous orb about the size of your fist.'
