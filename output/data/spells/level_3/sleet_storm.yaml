description: 'Until the spell ends, sleet falls in a 40-foot-tall, 20-foot-radius
    Cylinder centered on a point you choose within range. The area is Heavily Obscured,
    and exposed flames in the area are doused.


    Ground in the Cylinder is Difficult Terrain. When a creature enters the Cylinder
    for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there, it must succeed on a Dexterity
    saving throw or have the Prone condition and lose Concentration.'
