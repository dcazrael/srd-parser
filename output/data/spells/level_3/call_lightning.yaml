description: 'A storm cloud appears at a point within range that you can see above
    yourself. It takes the shape of a Cylinder that is 10 feet tall with a 60-foot
    radius.


    When you cast the spell, choose a point you can see under the cloud. A lightning
    bolt shoots from the cloud to that point. Each creature within 5 feet of that
    point makes a Dexterity saving throw, taking 3d10 Lightning damage on a failed
    save or half as much damage on a successful one.


    Until the spell ends, you can take a Magic action to call down lightning in that
    way again, targeting the same point or a different one.


    If you’re outdoors in a storm when you cast this spell, the spell gives you control
    over that storm instead of creating a new one. Under such conditions, the spell’s
    damage increases by 1d10. '
