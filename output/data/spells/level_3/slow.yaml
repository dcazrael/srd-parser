description: 'You alter time around up to six creatures of your choice in a 40-foot
    Cube within range. Each target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or be affected
    by this spell for the duration.


    An affected target’s Speed is halved, it takes a −2 penalty to AC and Dexterity
    saving throws, and it can’t take Reactions. On its turns, it can take either an
    action or a Bonus Action, not both, and it can make only one attack if it takes
    the Attack action. If it casts a spell with a Somatic component, there is a 25
    percent chance the spell fails as a result of the target making the spell’s gestures
    too slowly.


    An affected target repeats the save at the end of each of its turns, ending the
    spell on itself on a success.'
