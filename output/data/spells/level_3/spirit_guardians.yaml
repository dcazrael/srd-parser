description: 'Protective spirits flit around you in a 15-foot Emanation for the duration.
    If you are good or neutral, their spectral form appears angelic or fey (your choice).
    If you are evil, they appear fiendish.


    When you cast this spell, you can designate creatures to be unaffected by it.
    Any other creature’s Speed is halved in the Emanation, and whenever the Emanation
    enters a creature’s space and whenever a creature enters the Emanation or ends
    its turn there, the creature must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save,
    the creature takes 3d8 Radiant damage ( if you are good or neutral) or 3d8 Necrotic
    damage (if you are evil). On a successful save, the creature takes half as much
    damage. A creature makes this save only once per turn. '
