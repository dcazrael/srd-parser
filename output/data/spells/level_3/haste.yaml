description: 'Choose a willing creature that you can see within range. Until the spell
    ends, the targetâ€™s Speed is doubled, it gains a +2 bonus to Armor Class, it has
    Advantage on Dexterity saving throws, and it gains an additional action on each
    of its turns. That action can be used to take only the Attack (one attack only),
    Dash, Disengage, Hide, or Utilize action.


    When the spell ends, the target is Incapacitated and has a Speed of 0 until the
    end of its next turn, as a wave of lethargy washes over it.'
