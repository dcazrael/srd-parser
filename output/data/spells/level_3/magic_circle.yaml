description: 'You create a 10-foot-radius, 20-foot-tall Cylinder of magical energy
    centered on a point on the ground that you can see within range. Glowing runes
    appear wherever the Cylinder intersects with the floor or other surface.


    Choose one or more of the following types of creatures: Celestials, Elementals,
    Fey, Fiends, or Undead. The circle affects a creature of the chosen type in the
    following ways:


    The creature can’t willingly enter the Cylinder by nonmagical means. If the creature
    tries to use teleportation or interplanar travel to do so, it must first succeed
    on a Charisma saving throw.


    The creature has Disadvantage on attack rolls against targets within the Cylinder.


    Targets within the Cylinder can’t be possessed by or gain the Charmed or Frightened
    condition from the creature.


    Each time you cast this spell, you can cause its magic to operate in the reverse
    direction, preventing a creature of the specified type from leaving the Cylinder
    and protecting targets outside it. '
