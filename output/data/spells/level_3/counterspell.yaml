    You attempt to interrupt a creature in the process of casting a spell. The creature
    makes a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the spell dissipates with
    no effect, and the action, Bonus Action, or Reaction used to cast it is wasted.
    If that spell was cast with a spell slot, the slot isnâ€™t expended.'
