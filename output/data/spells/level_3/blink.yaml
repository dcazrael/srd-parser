description: 'Roll 1d6 at the end of each of your turns for the duration. On a roll
    of 4–6, you vanish from your current plane of existence and appear in the Ethereal
    Plane (the spell ends instantly if you are already on that plane). While on the
    Ethereal Plane, you can perceive the plane you left, which is cast in shades of
    gray, but you can’t see anything there more than 60 feet away. You can affect
    and be affected only by other creatures on the Ethereal Plane, and creatures on
    the other plane can’t perceive you unless they have a special ability that lets
    them perceive things on the Ethereal Plane.


    You return to the other plane at the start of your next turn and when the spell
    ends if you are on the Ethereal Plane. You return to an unoccupied space of your
    choice that you can see within 10 feet of the space you left. If no unoccupied
    space is available within that range, you appear in the nearest unoccupied space.'
