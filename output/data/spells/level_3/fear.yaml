description: 'Each creature in a 30-foot Cone must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw
    or drop whatever it is holding and have the Frightened condition for the duration.


    A Frightened creature takes the Dash action and moves away from you by the safest
    route on each of its turns unless there is nowhere to move. If the creature ends
    its turn in a space where it doesnâ€™t have line of sight to you, the creature makes
    a Wisdom saving throw. On a successful save, the spell ends on that creature.'
